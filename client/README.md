## Greenly

Greenly provides users the ability to track their carbon footprint by recording activities and the CO2e emissions associated with them.

Greenly is built using React, SASS and chart.js for the front end.
Node/Express for the backend, JWT token for Auth and mySQL for the database.

Greenly is fully deployed at https://greenly-tracker.herokuapp.com/

To install locally, run "npm i" in the "/client" and "/server" folders to install the node module dependencies.
